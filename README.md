# Jiyu's Protfolio & Blog

A static website build on top of Notion and Nextjs, Modified from [Craig Hart's Nobelium](https://github.com/craigary/nobelium).

**Why not use Nobelium directly?**

- 😭 Nobelium is using the old Notion API, which is deprecated and buggy
- 😁 New UI design
- 😁 using pnpm

## Technical details

- **Data Fetching**: Notion Official API [@notionhq/client](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js)
- **Generation**: Next.js and Incremental Static Regeneration
- **Page render**: [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x)
- **Style**: Tailwind CSS and `@tailwindcss/jit` compiler
- **Comments**: Gitalk, Cusdis and more

## Highlights ✨

**🚀 &nbsp;Fast and responsive**

- Fast page render and responsive design
- Fast static generation with efficient compiler

**🤖 &nbsp;Deploy instantly**

- Deploy on Vercel in minutes
- Incremental regeneration and no need to redeploy after update the content in notion

**🚙 &nbsp;Fully functional**

- RSS, analytics, web vital... and much more

**🎨 &nbsp;Easy for customization**
